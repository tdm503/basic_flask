-create a blog application, users will be able to register,log in,create posts,edit,delete

-How to organize code ??
-The project directory will contain:
+flaskr/, a Python package containing your application code and files.
+tests/, a directory containing test modules.
+.venv/, a Python virtual environment where Flask and other dependencies are installed.
-Run the application : flask --app flaskr run --debug
-Connect to database
-g is a special object that is unique for each request
-current_app is a special object that points to the Flask application handling the request
-Blueprint : A Blueprint is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. 
Rather than registering views and other code directly with an application, 
they are registered with a blueprint.
Then the blueprint is registered with the application when it is available in the factory function.
